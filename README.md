HTML 5 Canvas CRT Filter
========================

Applies a CRT-like filter to an HTML 5 canvas. The effect is achieved by applying a pixel-by-pixel transformation algorithm to the canvas image data.

To manipulate the canvas image data, by pixel, I'm using [flother's](https://github.com/flother) [CanvasImageData class](https://github.com/flother/examples/blob/gh-pages/canvas-blur/v1/canvas-image.js)
